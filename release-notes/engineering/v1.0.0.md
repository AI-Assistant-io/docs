## New Features

### Client Management
Create and manage API clients with base URLs and variables for organized test configurations.

### Test Cases
Define HTTP requests with full control over:
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Headers and query parameters
- JSON request bodies
- Expected status codes

### Test Execution
Run individual tests or full test suites with detailed results including response times and validation outcomes.

### Response Validation
JSONPath-based assertions for validating API responses with operators:
- equals, contains, exists, notExists
- greaterThan, lessThan (numeric comparisons)

### Variable System
- **Global Variables** - Master definitions shared across all clients
- **Client Variables** - Client-specific values that override globals
- **Variable Extraction** - Capture values from responses for test chaining

### Test Case Templates
Reusable test definitions organized in folders for consistent testing across multiple clients.

### Scheduled Runs
Cron-based automated test execution for continuous monitoring.

### Email Notifications
SMTP integration for test failure alerts with configurable recipients.
