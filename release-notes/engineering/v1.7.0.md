# Release v1.7.0

**Release Date:** 2025-01-24

---

## New Features

### Client Variables on Landing Page (PR #22, Issue #12)
Client variables management has been moved from the test cases page to the client landing page for better accessibility.

- **Full Variable Management**: View, add, edit, and delete variables directly from the client landing page
- **Inline Editing**: Click on any variable value to edit it in place
- **Filter Support**: Search through variables when you have more than 10
- **Required vs Custom**: Clear visual distinction between required and custom variables

---

## Technical Changes

### Frontend
- Added variable management to `ClientLanding.tsx` with full CRUD operations
- Removed Variables tab from `ClientDetail.tsx` (now only Test Cases and Test Runs tabs)
- Removed variable-related modals from `ClientDetail.tsx`
- Simplified `TabType` to only include 'test-cases' and 'test-runs'

---

## UI/UX Improvements

- Variables are now easily accessible from the main client view
- Better discoverability when managing client configuration
- Consistent with client-level concerns being on the landing page

---

## Bug Fixes

None

---

## Breaking Changes

- The Variables tab is no longer available on the test cases page
- Direct links to `/clients/:id/test-cases?tab=variables` will now show test cases instead
