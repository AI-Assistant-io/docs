## New Features

### Azure Resource Checks in Test Runs (PR #30, Issue #27)
Azure resource verification is now integrated into the test run workflow.

- **Automatic Resource Checks**: When Azure is configured, resource group existence is checked before API tests run
- **Included in Test Counts**: Resource checks count toward total/passed/failed test statistics
- **Test Run Details**: Resource checks displayed separately with Azure cloud icon
- **Visual Distinction**: Resource type badge (e.g., "ResourceGroup") distinguishes from API tests
- **Status Tracking**: Shows "Exists", "Created", or "Not Found" status for each resource

## Technical Changes

### Backend
- Modified `testExecutor.ts` to run Azure resource checks before API tests
- Resource checks are stored in `AzureResourceChecks` table with `testRunId`
- Updated `testRunController.ts` to:
  - Include resource check count in `totalTests`
  - Return `resourceChecks` array in test run details
  - Calculate resource check count at test run start

### Frontend
- Added `ResourceCheck` interface to `TestRunDetail.tsx`
- New "Azure Resource Checks" section displays before API test results
- Cloud icon and blue badge for resource type distinction
- Status indicators: green for passed (exists/created), red for failed

### API Response Changes
- `GET /api/test-runs/:id` now includes `resourceChecks` array
- `POST /api/test-runs` response includes `resourceCheckCount`

## Extensibility

The implementation is designed to support additional Azure resource types in the future:
- Storage Accounts
- Key Vaults
- App Services
- etc.

Resource checks use a `resourceType` field to distinguish between different check types.

## Bug Fixes

None
