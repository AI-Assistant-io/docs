## New Features

### Immutable Region and Abbreviated Name (PR #19, Issue #17)
Azure Region and Abbreviated Name are now locked after initial configuration to ensure consistent Azure resource naming.

- **Backend Validation**: Prevents updates to regionId and abbreviatedName once set
- **Locked Field Indicators**: Lock icon and "Locked" label shown for immutable fields
- **Disabled Fields**: Fields become read-only after initial save
- **Warning Message**: Prominent warning explaining fields cannot be changed later
- **Acknowledgment Checkbox**: Users must confirm understanding before saving

---

## Technical Changes

- Updated `clientController.ts` to validate and reject changes to immutable fields
- Updated `Clients.tsx` with locked field UI, warning message, and acknowledgment flow
- Added visual lock icon using SVG inline icons
- Conditional rendering of warning only when setting new values

---

## UI/UX Improvements

- Clear visual distinction between editable and locked fields
- Amber-colored warning box with icon for important notices
- Checkbox acknowledgment prevents accidental permanent configuration
- Tooltip on lock icon explaining why field is locked
