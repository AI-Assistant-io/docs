## Bug Fixes

### Fix Authentication Loop on Page Load (PR #49, Issue #48)
Fixed an issue where the loading page would enter a repeated loop when opening the application. Which is now resolved

**Root Cause:** The API service's 401 error handler was redirecting to `/login`, which doesn't exist as a route. This caused the catch-all route to redirect back to `/`, triggering the auth check again in an infinite loop.

**Changes:**
- **api.ts**: Removed 401 redirect to non-existent `/login` route. Auth0 SDK with refresh tokens now handles token refresh automatically. If the token is truly invalid, `isAuthenticated` becomes false and ProtectedRoute shows the login screen.
- **Unauthorized.tsx**: Simplified to single "Sign Out & Return to Portal" button that redirects to `portal.ai-assistant.io` after logout
- **Navbar.tsx**: Updated logout to redirect to `portal.ai-assistant.io` for consistency

**Portal Integration:** All logouts now redirect to the portal (`portal.ai-assistant.io`), ensuring users without the required role don't get stuck in a redirect loop between the engineering app and portal.

## Configuration Required

Ensure `https://portal.ai-assistant.io` is added to your Auth0 application's **Allowed Logout URLs** setting.
