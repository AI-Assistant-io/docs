## New Features

You can now switch between communication channels while preserving your conversation history.

- **Supported channels:** Web Chat, WhatsApp, Email, SMS
- **History preserved:** All previous messages load automatically in the new channel view

**Where to find it:**
- **Web Chat:** Channel switch buttons in the Actions panel (expand chat first)
- **WhatsApp:** Three-dot menu → "Continue on..." section
- **Email:** "New conversation" dropdown → "Continue on..." section
- **SMS:** Channel badge dropdown in header
