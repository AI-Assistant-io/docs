## New Features

### Branch Context for Templates (PR #17, Issue #16)
Templates now include branch details so the agent knows which dealership the customer is associated with and can provide accurate location information.

- **Branch data includes:** Brand, branch name, address, phone, email, opening hours (sales & service), directions
- **Agent responds correctly** when customers ask "Where are you?", "What are your hours?", "How do I get there?"
- **All templates updated** with branch context (ServiceIntoSales, ServiceReminder, FollowUp, NewArrival, EVHC, Finance)

**Example:**
> Customer: "What are your opening hours?"
> Agent: "BMW Bristol is open Mon-Fri 8:30am-6pm for sales and 8am-6pm for service. Saturdays we're open 9am-5pm for sales and 8:30am-12:30pm for service. We're closed Sundays."
