**Release Date:** 2026-01-22

## New Features

### VHC Data Support (PR #8, Issue #8)
Added support for Vehicle Health Check (VHC) data in templates, enabling agents to reference outstanding service work items when communicating with customers.

- **Dynamic data transformation:** `workIdentified` arrays from VHC JSON are automatically formatted for agent context
- **Priority-based formatting:** Items grouped by priority level (Red/Amber/Green) with descriptions
- **Cost summaries:** Total costs calculated automatically from individual work items

### Email Debug Panel
Added a debug panel to the Email channel for viewing agent internals during development.

- **Toggle visibility:** "Show Debug" checkbox in the email header
- **Fixed position:** Panel pinned to right side of screen, doesn't interfere with email flow
- **Shows:** Run status, token usage, tool calls, and contextualized message sent to agent

### Improved Email Thread Layout
Redesigned Email channel to mirror real email client behaviour.

- **Newest first:** New messages appear at the top of the thread
- **Original as footer:** Initial outreach message displayed as quoted footer text
- **Better readability:** Clear visual separation between conversation and original message

## Improvements

### Shorter, More Natural Agent Responses
Updated main agent (Zoe) instructions to produce more human-like responses.

- **Concise writing:** Responses are now 2-4 sentences instead of lengthy formatted documents
- **Less markdown:** Removed excessive use of headers (###), bold text, and bullet points
- **Conversational tone:** Responses read like messages from a friendly colleague, not a brochure

---

## Technical Changes

- Added `format_vhc_items()` helper function to transform VHC data structures
- Added `DEMO_DATA["EVHC"]` with raw `workIdentified` format
- Updated `get_demo_data()` to auto-transform VHC data when present
- Added debug parameter to `send_message()` and `/api/chat` endpoint
- Added "Writing Style - CRITICAL" section to main agent instructions
- Simplified channel format examples in agent instructions

## Bug Fixes
